##Functions to be used in this code :

##function to Start and Reset the Game
function startGame(){

};
function resetGameState(){
    if (the tetris fills the board){
        startGame();
    }
};

##Functions to move the Tetris in the board
moveRight();
moveLeft();
rotateTetris();

##This displays the highScore and update it each time it's beaten
updateHighScore();

#Problems Faced
- Making the Game board
- Creating the shapes in grids
- Writng the game logic : Movements , High Score Update and Rotation

#Documentation of my findings & research
Instead of uisng padding to create the game board which was not consistent.
I used a given width and height to make it contain game elements and made it grid to ensure it's responsive.
